This needs to be a fillable (-ish) form. =)

My decisions about _____________ are not up for debate.
They are dictated by me, not by

    * community consensus
    * taking a survey amongst all present
    * any random person who cares to weigh in
    * you
    * anyone else

Specifically, I reject your

    * attempts to recharacterize problematic behavior as benign
    * attempts to discredit [evidence]
    * attempts to discredit [person]
    * attempts to discredit my evaluation of [evidence]
    * attempts to usurp my personal sovereignty
    * attempts to gaslight me
    * attempts to push your standards of evidence upon me
    * attempts to push your criteria of decision-making upon me
    * attempts to characterize me as not objective
    * attempts to characterize me as irrational
    * attempts to characterize me as overly emotional or hysterical
    * assertion that I don't have enough evidence to make a decision
    * assertion that I am not entitled to form an opinion
    * assertion that I am not entitled to share a clearly-delineated opinion
    * assertion that you are more qualified than I to make decisions
      about my life
    * assertion that you are more objective than I am
    * assertion that intent is magic
    * assertion that a Nice Guy could not have done this
    * assertion that I am responsible for the harm caused by
      someone else's actions
    * assertion that remorse absolves someone of responsibility for
      their actions
    * assertion that forgiveness is something I owe somebody
    * (implied) assertion that my decisions are not legitimate until
      they are proven to your liking
    * (implied) assertion that I have any obligation to explain the
      rationale behind my decisions to you

    * presumption of innocence until proven guilty by a court of law
      ...that I must ignore any & all facts/accusations 'til proven
    * that you can tell me how much risk I should tolerate
      or how to manage it

    * irrelevant information
    * (faux) logic
    * concern trolling
    * tone argument
    * presumption that your lived experience is that of everybody everywhere
    * attempts to discredit my lived experience



In closing, I would like to remind you that because they are
my decisions and I am the final authority upon them,

    * there is no court of appeal
    * there will be no judicial review
    * a public inquiry will not be called
    * I am done discussing this subject with you

I hope this clarifies for you who it is that makes decisions about my life.
Thanks!  Have a nice day!
